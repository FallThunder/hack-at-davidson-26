# The Problem

Modern information moves faster than verification.

Users encounter articles constantly across:

- Social media
- News websites
- Forums
- Blogs
- Shared links

But determining credibility requires:

- Researching sources
- Checking claims
- Evaluating bias
- Comparing viewpoints

Most users do not have the time or tools to do this.

This creates an environment where misinformation spreads easily.

Evident brings AI-powered credibility analysis directly into the browser.

With one click, Evident provides:

- Credibility rating
