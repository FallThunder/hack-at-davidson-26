ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES OF "EVIDENT"
=====================================
A Plain-Language Guide for New Users
=====================================

WHAT IS EVIDENT?
-----------------
Evident is a browser extension (currently for Chrome) that analyzes news articles
and websites for trustworthiness, political bias, factual reporting quality, and
more. It appears as a side panel while you browse, showing scores, flags, and
summaries about the page you are reading.

This document describes every accessibility feature built into Evident — both the
features that make Evident itself easy to use for people with disabilities, and
the features Evident uses to evaluate how accessible the websites you visit are.


PART 1: FEATURES THAT MAKE EVIDENT ITSELF MORE ACCESSIBLE
===========================================================

1. SCREEN READER SUPPORT
--------------------------
Evident is designed to work with screen readers (software like NVDA, JAWS, or
VoiceOver that reads content aloud for blind or low-vision users).

- Every button that uses only an icon (no visible text) has an invisible label
  that screen readers will announce. For example, the settings button is labeled
  "Manage news sites" and the dark mode toggle says "Switch to light mode" or
  "Switch to dark mode" depending on the current state.

- The "Remove [domain]" buttons in the site management panel each include the
  site name in their label, so a screen reader won't just say "Remove" — it will
  say exactly which site will be removed.

- Visual scores and meters (like political bias and factual reporting) are marked
  up as proper ARIA meter elements, meaning a screen reader can announce a value
  like "Political bias meter: 60 out of 100."

- The Trust Score circular gauge is labeled with text like "Trust Score: 74 out
  of 100. Good." so screen reader users get the full picture without relying on
  the visual chart.

- Decorative icons, emojis, and animated SVG graphics that add no informational
  value are hidden from screen readers using aria-hidden="true", so they don't
  clutter the reading experience.

- Loading skeleton cards (the placeholder shapes that appear while analysis is
  running) are also hidden from screen readers so they are not announced.

- When Evident finishes analyzing a page, or when an error occurs, the update is
  announced to screen readers automatically via a "live region" — a behind-the-
  scenes mechanism that tells screen readers to read out new content without the
  user having to navigate to it.

- Error messages use the "alert" role, which causes screen readers to interrupt
  and announce the error immediately.

- Collapsible sections (like the "Built-in sites" list) communicate whether they
  are expanded or collapsed using aria-expanded, so screen reader users always
  know the current state.


2. KEYBOARD NAVIGATION
-----------------------
Every interactive element in Evident can be reached and activated using just a
keyboard — no mouse required.

- Flag cards (the cards showing individual concerns found in an article) can be
  focused with the Tab key and activated with Enter or Space, just like a button.

- The excerpt inside a flag card (a quote from the article) can also be focused
  and pressed with Enter or Space to jump directly to that passage in the article.

- The Trust Score gauge is focusable and responds to keyboard focus by showing a
  visual highlight ring.

- When you open the "Manage news sites" panel, the text input for adding a new
  site receives focus automatically, so you can start typing right away without
  clicking.

- In that same panel, pressing Enter in the text input submits the form.


3. VISIBLE FOCUS INDICATORS
-----------------------------
When you navigate with a keyboard, a visible colored ring appears around the
element that is currently focused, so you always know where you are on the page.

- Flag cards show an indigo (blue-purple) ring when focused.
- The excerpt inside a flag card shows a thinner indigo ring.
- The site input field shows an indigo ring.
- Focus rings are shown only for keyboard focus (not when clicking with a mouse),
  reducing visual clutter for mouse users while still helping keyboard users.


4. DARK MODE
-------------
Evident fully supports both light and dark color schemes.

- When you first install Evident, it automatically checks your operating system's
  color preference (Settings > Appearance on Windows/Mac/Linux) and uses that.

- You can also manually toggle between light and dark mode using a button in the
  Evident header. This preference is remembered between sessions.

- Every part of the Evident panel — text, backgrounds, badges, buttons, meters,
  tooltips, and in-page highlights — has been styled for both modes with
  sufficient color contrast.

- Page highlights (the colored underlining Evident applies to flagged text in the
  article itself) also adapt to dark mode using a data attribute on the document.


5. REDUCED MOTION SUPPORT
---------------------------
Some users experience discomfort, dizziness, or seizures from on-screen
animations. Evident respects the "Reduce Motion" system setting available on
Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and most Linux desktops.

- The Trust Score gauge normally animates from 0 to the final score with a
  spinning arc. When reduced motion is preferred, it jumps directly to the
  final number with no animation.

- The "shimmer" loading animation on skeleton cards is disabled when reduced
  motion is preferred.

- All transitions and animations on in-page highlights and tooltips are
  disabled when reduced motion is preferred.

- When Evident scrolls the article to show you a flagged passage, it normally
  uses a smooth scrolling animation. With reduced motion preferred, it jumps
  instantly instead.

- Fade-in animations on dimension cards and the trust meter are skipped when
  reduced motion is preferred.


6. LISTEN TO SUMMARY (AUDIO ACCESSIBILITY)
--------------------------------------------
For users who prefer listening to reading, Evident includes a "Listen to Summary"
button that reads the article analysis aloud using text-to-speech (powered by
ElevenLabs). The button's label updates to reflect the current state (e.g.,
"Loading audio…", "Pause", etc.) so screen reader users always know what will
happen when they press it.


7. SEMANTIC HTML STRUCTURE
---------------------------
The Evident landing page (the website where you can download the extension) uses
proper HTML document structure:

- The page has a single <h1> main heading, followed by <h2> section headings and
  <h3> subheadings in the correct order — no levels are skipped.
- Navigation links are in a <nav> element.
- The main content is wrapped in a <main> element.
- The footer is in a <footer> element.
- The page is declared as English with lang="en" on the <html> element.
- All images have descriptive alt text (e.g., "Evident logo").
- Links use descriptive text like "Download for Chrome" rather than vague phrases
  like "click here."


8. DOCUMENT METADATA
---------------------
All HTML pages in Evident (the extension panel, the landing page, and the
website) include:

- A proper page title.
- A language declaration (lang="en") so screen readers know which language to use.
- A charset declaration (UTF-8) for proper text rendering.
- A responsive viewport meta tag so the layout works on all screen sizes.


==============================================================
PART 2: EVIDENT'S BUILT-IN ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT FOR WEBSITES
==============================================================

In addition to analyzing news bias and factuality, Evident also evaluates the
accessibility of the page you are visiting and gives it an "Accessibility Score"
out of 100. This score appears in the A11y (accessibility) card in the Evident
panel.

Here is what Evident checks and how it scores each item:


CHECK 1 — LANGUAGE DECLARATION (up to 15 points)
--------------------------------------------------
Evident checks whether the page declares what language it is written in using the
HTML lang attribute. Without this, screen readers may mispronounce words by
guessing the wrong language.

  Example issue message: "Page is missing a language declaration"
  This corresponds to WCAG criterion 3.1.1 (Language of Page).


CHECK 2 — IMAGES WITH ALT TEXT (up to 20 points)
--------------------------------------------------
Evident finds all images on the page and checks whether each one has an alt
attribute describing what the image shows. Without alt text, blind users receive
no information about the image.

  Penalty: 5 points per image missing alt text, up to a maximum of 20 points.
  Example issue message: "Images missing alt text"
  This corresponds to WCAG criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content).


CHECK 3 — HEADING LEVEL HIERARCHY (up to 10 points)
-----------------------------------------------------
Evident checks that the page's headings go in order (h1, h2, h3…) without
skipping levels. Skipping from h1 to h3 breaks the logical outline that screen
reader users rely on to navigate a page.

  Example issue message: "Heading levels are skipped"
  This corresponds to WCAG criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).


CHECK 4 — DESCRIPTIVE LINK TEXT (up to 15 points)
---------------------------------------------------
Evident scans the page for links whose visible text is vague or meaningless
("click here", "here", "read more", "more", "link", or empty). Screen reader
users often navigate by jumping from link to link, so each link needs to make
sense on its own. Evident allows an aria-label override — if a link has a
meaningful aria-label even though its visible text is generic, it is not flagged.

  Penalty: 5 points per non-descriptive link, up to a maximum of 15 points.
  Example issue message: "Links with non-descriptive text"
  This corresponds to WCAG criteria 2.4.4 and 2.4.9 (Link Purpose).


CHECK 5 — BUTTONS WITH LABELS (up to 10 points)
------------------------------------------------
Evident finds all buttons on the page and checks whether each one has an
accessible name — either visible text inside the button, an aria-label attribute,
or a title attribute. Icon-only buttons without any label are invisible to screen
reader users.

  Penalty: 5 points per unlabeled button, up to a maximum of 10 points.
  Example issue message: "Buttons with no accessible label"
  This corresponds to WCAG criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).


CHECK 6 — PAGE TITLE (up to 10 points)
----------------------------------------
Evident checks whether the page has a non-empty <title> element in its HTML.
The page title is the first thing a screen reader announces when a page loads,
and it is what appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.

  Example issue message: "Page is missing a title"
  This corresponds to WCAG criterion 2.4.2 (Page Titled).


HOW THE ACCESSIBILITY SCORE IS CALCULATED
------------------------------------------
The page starts with a perfect score of 100. Points are deducted for each issue
found, up to the cap for each category. The final score is displayed with a label:

  90–100 : Excellent
  70–89  : Good
  50–69  : Fair
  0–49   : Poor

Individual issues are listed below the score so you can see exactly what problems
were found and how many instances there are.


==============================================================
SUMMARY
==============================================================

Evident is built with accessibility as a first-class concern in two ways:

1. The extension itself is usable by people who rely on screen readers, keyboard
   navigation, reduced motion settings, dark mode, or audio alternatives.

2. As part of its page analysis, Evident actively audits every page you visit
   against six key WCAG 2.1 accessibility criteria and gives you a plain-language
   report — helping you identify which sites are doing well for disabled users
   and which ones have room to improve.
