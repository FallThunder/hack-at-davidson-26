WHAT IS EVIDENT?
----------------
Evident is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. When you visit a news
article, it opens a side panel and analyzes that article using AI. It tells
you how trustworthy the article is, flags specific sentences that may contain
misleading claims, and shows background information about the publisher. All
of this information is displayed visually in a panel alongside the article.

The following is a complete description of every accessibility feature built
into the extension.


---
1. SCREEN READER SUPPORT
---

Evident is designed to work with screen readers — assistive software that
reads page content aloud for users who are blind or have low vision. Every
meaningful piece of information has a text alternative so it can be
understood without looking at the screen.

TRUST SCORE GAUGE
  The centerpiece of Evident is a circular arc gauge showing the article's
  trust score from 0 to 100. Visually it looks like a progress ring with a
  color (green, yellow, orange, or red) and a number in the center. Screen
  readers skip the visual ring entirely and instead announce a plain-language
  label, for example: "Trust Score: 72 out of 100. Mostly Reliable."

  The gauge can also be hovered (or focused by keyboard) to reveal a
  breakdown of the five components that make up the score: Publisher,
  Bias, Factuality, Tone, and Claims. Each segment appears with its own
  label and sub-score.

DECORATIVE ICONS AND GRAPHICS
  All SVG icons that are purely decorative — loading spinners, the search
  icon shown on empty states, the logo graphic — are marked as hidden from
  screen readers using aria-hidden="true". This prevents the screen reader
  from reading out raw SVG code, which would be meaningless.

POLITICAL BIAS BAR
  The publisher section shows a horizontal bar representing the outlet's
  political leaning, from left to right. Visually this is a gradient bar
  with a dot indicator. For screen readers, it is announced as a meter,
  for example: "Political bias: Center-Left, position 38 out of 100 from
  left to right."

FACTUAL REPORTING BAR
  A second bar shows how factually reliable the publisher's reporting
  historically is. Screen readers hear, for example: "Factual reporting:
  Mostly Factual, score 72 out of 100."

ARTICLE TONE AND FACTUALITY BADGES
  Colored pill-shaped badges appear in the publisher section, such as
  "Neutral" (blue) or "High" (green). Each badge has an accessible label
  that spells out what it means: "Article tone: Neutral" and
  "Factuality: High." The color is not the only way the information is
  conveyed — the text is always present too.

FACT FLAG CARDS
  When the AI identifies a potentially misleading or unverified claim in
  the article, it creates a "flag card" in the side panel. Each card shows:
    - A colored dot and a "3/5" style urgency number (both hidden from
      screen readers)
    - A semantic urgency label read aloud instead, e.g.:
      "Urgency: 3 of 5 — moderate"
    - The flag type name (e.g., "Missing Context", "Unverified Statistic")
    - A quoted excerpt from the article
    - The AI's reasoning
    - Source links

JUMP-TO-ARTICLE EXCERPTS
  Inside each flag card, the quoted excerpt from the article is a clickable
  element. Clicking it scrolls the article to that highlighted passage.
  For screen readers, this element is labeled: "Jump to this passage in
  the article."

SHOW MORE / SHOW LESS BUTTONS
  When a flag card's reasoning text is long, it is initially collapsed to
  two lines. A "Show more" / "Show less" button expands or collapses it.
  This button uses aria-expanded so a screen reader announces whether the
  full text is currently visible or hidden.

ERROR MESSAGES
  If analysis fails for any reason, an error panel appears. It uses
  role="alert", which causes screen readers to announce the error
  immediately and automatically — the user does not have to navigate to it.

LOADING STATUS MESSAGES
  While analysis is running, a cycling status message appears:
  "Reading article...", "Analyzing article...", "Checking factual
  claims...", "Evaluating sources...", "Assessing rhetoric...",
  "Reviewing statistics..." These messages are inside a live region
  (role="status" aria-live="polite"), so screen readers announce each
  new message at a natural pause in reading — without interrupting
  whatever the user is currently hearing.

SLOW SERVER AND OVERLOADED WARNINGS
  If the backend is slow or overloaded, warning banners appear in amber.
  These also use live regions so they are announced to screen reader users
  automatically.

HIGHLIGHT TOGGLE BUTTON
  At the bottom of the side panel, a sticky button lets users show or hide
  the colored highlights injected into the article. This button uses
  aria-pressed to communicate its current on/off state to screen readers.
  When analysis is still in progress, the button is disabled and reads
  "Waiting for analysis..."

FLAG CARD ACTIVE STATE
  When a user clicks a highlight in the article, the corresponding flag
  card in the side panel becomes "active" — it is scrolled into view and
  visually outlined. This selected state is communicated via
  aria-pressed="true" so screen readers know which flag is currently
  in focus.

LOADING SKELETON PLACEHOLDERS
  While data is loading, the panel shows animated gray placeholder cards
  in the shape of the real cards. These placeholders are marked
  aria-hidden="true" so screen readers do not read out meaningless
  placeholder content. The live status message (see above) handles
  communicating progress instead.

MANAGE SITES MODAL
  The settings panel for managing which news domains Evident will analyze
  has a proper heading ("Manage News Sites" as an h2 element). The Close
  button has aria-label="Close". Each custom domain's remove button is
  labeled "Remove example.com" — not just an "X" icon with no label.

COLLAPSIBLE BUILT-IN SITES LIST
  The panel includes a collapsible list of hundreds of built-in supported
  news domains. The toggle button uses aria-expanded to tell screen readers
  whether the list is currently shown or hidden.

HEADER BUTTONS
  The settings (sliders) icon button reads "Manage news sites."
  The dark/light mode toggle reads "Switch to dark mode" or "Switch to
  light mode" depending on the current state.


---
2. FULL KEYBOARD NAVIGATION
---

Every interactive element in Evident can be reached and operated by
keyboard alone — no mouse is required.

FLAG CARDS
  Each flag card is focusable with the Tab key. Pressing Enter or Space
  activates the card, which selects it and scrolls the article to the
  corresponding highlighted text.

ARTICLE EXCERPT JUMP LINK
  The quoted excerpt inside a flag card is also keyboard-accessible.
  Pressing Enter or Space scrolls the article page to that passage.

TRUST METER BREAKDOWN
  Hovering over the circular gauge reveals the score breakdown into five
  components. For keyboard users, the gauge ring is focusable with Tab.
  When it receives focus, the breakdown appears automatically.

DOMAIN INPUT (MANAGE SITES)
  In the Manage Sites panel, pressing Enter in the domain text field
  submits the form — matching the standard browser behavior users expect.

FOCUS RINGS
  Every focusable element displays a visible indigo focus ring when it
  receives keyboard focus. This makes it easy to see where focus is on
  screen at all times. The focus ring is suppressed for mouse clicks
  (using :focus-visible) so it only appears during keyboard navigation.

AUTO-FOCUS ON MODAL OPEN
  When the Manage Sites panel opens, keyboard focus is automatically moved
  to the domain input field. Users do not have to Tab through the entire
  interface to start typing.

NATIVE BUTTON ELEMENTS
  Interactive elements are implemented as real <button> elements wherever
  possible rather than styled <div> or <span> elements. This means they
  automatically receive Tab focus, respond to Enter and Space, and work
  correctly with all assistive technologies without needing extra code.


---
3. MOTION SENSITIVITY (prefers-reduced-motion)
---

Evident respects the "Reduce Motion" setting available in Windows, macOS,
iOS, Android, and Linux. When this system preference is enabled, all
animations and transitions are adjusted or removed:

TRUST SCORE COUNT-UP ANIMATION
  Normally the trust score counts up from 0 to its final value over 1.2
  seconds with an easing curve. With reduced motion enabled, the score
  appears instantly at its final value — no animation.

SCROLL BEHAVIOR
  When clicking an excerpt or a flag card causes the article or side panel
  to scroll, it normally scrolls smoothly. With reduced motion, scrolling
  is instantaneous.

INLINE HIGHLIGHT HOVER EFFECT
  Highlighted text in the article normally brightens slightly on hover.
  With reduced motion, this transition is removed.

HIGHLIGHT PULSE ON SCROLL-TO
  When the side panel scrolls you to a specific highlight in the article,
  that highlight normally pulses briefly (brightens and dims) to draw
  attention. With reduced motion, the pulse animation is disabled.

TOOLTIP FADE
  The hover tooltip above highlighted text normally fades in. With reduced
  motion, it appears instantly.

ENTRANCE ANIMATIONS
  Cards in the side panel use a subtle "fade in and slide up" entrance
  animation. This animation only plays when motion is safe (it uses the
  Tailwind CSS motion-safe: prefix, which automatically respects the
  system preference).


---
4. DARK MODE AND VISUAL COMFORT
---

AUTOMATIC SYSTEM SYNC
  Evident reads the operating system's light/dark mode preference on
  startup and applies the matching theme automatically. If your OS is in
  dark mode, Evident opens in dark mode.

MANUAL OVERRIDE WITH PERSISTENCE
  The sun/moon button in the top-right corner of the header lets users
  manually switch between light and dark mode at any time. The choice is
  saved to browser storage and remembered across all future sessions.

FULL THEME COVERAGE
  Dark mode applies consistently to every part of the interface: the side
  panel background, all cards, the trust meter ring labels, badges, input
  fields, buttons, borders, text colors, and even the tooltips and click
  popovers that Evident injects directly onto the news article page.

CONTRAST IN BOTH MODES
  Both themes use color pairs chosen for readable contrast between
  foreground text and background surfaces.


---
5. COLOR IS NEVER THE ONLY SIGNAL
---

Evident never uses color alone to convey meaning. This is important for
users who are color blind or who use high-contrast display modes.

URGENCY LEVELS (FACT FLAGS)
  The severity of each fact flag (1 through 5) is communicated using
  multiple simultaneous signals, not just color:

    Level 1 (very low) — yellow background, dotted bottom border, 2px
    Level 2 (low)      — yellow background, dotted bottom border, 2px
    Level 3 (moderate) — orange background, dashed bottom border, 2px
    Level 4 (high)     — red background, solid bottom border, 2px
    Level 5 (critical) — red background, solid bottom border, 3px

  In addition, each card shows a "3/5" numeric label (visible to sighted
  users) and a full semantic label ("Urgency: 3 of 5 — moderate") read
  aloud to screen reader users.

TRUST SCORE TIERS
  The trust score arc is colored green, yellow, orange, or red. The same
  information is also conveyed in the text tier label displayed below the
  score: "High Trust", "Mostly Reliable", "Use Caution", or "Low Trust."

TONE AND FACTUALITY BADGES
  These badges use both color and text to communicate their value. For
  example: "Sensationalist" (orange text on orange background), "Neutral"
  (blue on blue), "High" (green on green), "Mixed" (yellow on yellow).

PUBLISHER BIAS AND FACTUALITY BARS
  These gradient bars include text labels at both ends ("Left" / "Right",
  "Low" / "High") and a text label in the center showing the rated
  category (e.g., "Political Bias: Center-Left").


---
6. SEMANTIC HTML STRUCTURE
---

The extension uses the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose,
which benefits screen readers, keyboard navigation, and browser built-in
behaviors:

  <blockquote>  — Article excerpts inside flag cards
  <h2>          — "Manage News Sites" heading in the settings modal
  <button>      — All interactive controls
  <input>       — The domain entry field in Manage Sites
  <a>           — Source links in flag cards, opened in a new tab
                  with rel="noopener noreferrer" for security


---
7. TRANSPARENT LOADING STATES
---

Analysis takes several seconds. Evident communicates progress clearly:

  - Animated skeleton (placeholder) cards appear in the panel while data
    loads, giving a sense of the layout to come. These are hidden from
    screen readers so they don't create noise.

  - A visible, screen-reader-announced status message cycles through
    descriptions of what is happening step by step.

  - A 2-minute slow-response warning appears if analysis is unusually slow,
    both visually and via a screen-reader live region.

  - If the AI backend becomes overloaded, a separate warning appears
    explaining that the system is retrying automatically.


---
8. WHAT IS NOT YET COVERED
---

The following accessibility features do not currently exist in Evident and
represent opportunities for future improvement:

AUDIO / TEXT-TO-SPEECH
  There is no way for users to have the trust score, flag reasoning,
  publisher profile, or article excerpts read aloud by a high-quality AI
  voice. Users who are blind or have low vision rely entirely on their own
  screen reader software to read the extension. Integrating a service like
  ElevenLabs to offer an in-extension "Read aloud" button for key content
  would be a meaningful improvement.

VOICE CONTROL
  Users cannot speak commands to navigate or interact with the extension.

DEDICATED HIGH-CONTRAST MODE
  There is no explicit high-contrast visual theme beyond the existing
  light and dark modes.

LANGUAGE AND INTERNATIONALIZATION
  All text in the extension is in English only. There is no support for
  other languages or right-to-left text layouts.
