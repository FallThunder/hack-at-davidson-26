        "reasoning": "U.S. electricity prices have risen due to a range of factors including grid infrastructure investment, natural gas price volatility, and extreme weather events.

The calculation includes speculative long-term projections and counts avoided compliance costs as savings, a methodology contested by economists. Multiple independent analyses project net costs to consumers from increased climate damages that are not accounted for in this figure.",
