        "excerpt": "nothing has changed for revenue goals",
        "reasoning": "Bessent's claim that tariff revenue will be 'virtually unchanged' relies on replacing IEEPA tariffs with Section 122 authority, which is capped at 15% and expires after 150 days unless Congress votes to extend it. The article does not convey these critical statutory limitations, creating a materially false impression that revenues are secure on the same terms. In reality, Section 122 is a time-limited and rate-capped fallback that represents a significant structural downgrade from IEEPA authority.",

        "reasoning": "The article frames the embargo power as a newly 'reaffirmed' and enhanced presidential tool. However, the court's ruling did not affirmatively expand or reaffirm presidential embargo power — it struck down IEEPA tariff authority. The majority opinion did not address embargo powers at all; Bessent's interpretation extrapolates from what the court did NOT prohibit rather than what it endorsed. Presenting this as a Supreme Court 'reaffirmation' of embargo authority mischaracterizes the ruling's scope.",

        "reasoning": "The article quotes Bessent's claim without noting key limitations: Section 122 tariffs are capped at 15% and automatically expire after 150 days unless Congress votes to extend them. The article also omits that Section 122 has never before been invoked to impose tariffs.

        "excerpt": "Trump called the Supreme Court's ruling 'deeply disappointing' and said he is 'ashamed' of the six justices",
        "reasoning": "The article reports Trump's emotional attack on the justices without noting that the 6-3 majority included three of his own conservative appointees (Gorsuch and Barrett joined Roberts), and that the dissent was written by Kavanaugh — a fact that materially undercuts any implication of partisan judicial bias. Without this context, readers may incorrectly infer the majority was composed of liberal or non-Trump-appointed justices.",
