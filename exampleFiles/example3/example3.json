        "reasoning": "The article dismisses ramp-based theories wholesale and declares with confidence that this new theory 'works,' but the mainstream archaeological consensus is that ramp-based theories remain the most credible, if incomplete, explanations. Multiple Egyptologists and engineers maintain that some form of ramp was almost certainly used. The new subtraction/trapezoid theory has not been peer-reviewed or subjected to archaeological scrutiny in any documented form found in the literature, so declaring it definitively as a working theory overstates its standing significantly.",

The three main Giza pyramids were built by different pharaohs over roughly a century and have distinct stone sources. This specific claim is speculative and not documented in Egyptological literature.",
